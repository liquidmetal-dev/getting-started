# :runner: Getting started with Liquid Metal

Want help/advice on getting started with Liquid Metal? Well this the place for you!

Currently we have:

* [docs](docs/intro.md) - various documentation including how to get started with your own environment in Equinix and how to do some basic troubleshooting.
* [Equinix Metal Demo](demos/static-equinix/) - a scripted demo to go use with a environment created in Equinux (instructions [here](docs/intro.md#terraform-an-environment-on-equinix)).
* [Terraform](terraform/) - creates a demo environment running in Equinix metal for the above demo/docs.

> The resources here will be expanding over time. We also :heart: contributions and suggestions.
